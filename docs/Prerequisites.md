## Prerequisites for Code-Narrator

Before you can fork and modify the code of the Code-Narrator project, you need to have the following software, tools, and knowledge:

1. **Node.js**: Code-Narrator is built using Node.js, so you need to have it installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **npm**: npm is the package manager for Node.js and is used to manage the project's dependencies. It comes bundled with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

3. **TypeScript**: The project is written in TypeScript, so you need to have a basic understanding of TypeScript and its syntax. You can learn more about TypeScript from the [official TypeScript website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

4. **Git**: You need to have Git installed on your system to fork and clone the project repository. You can download Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

5. **Code-Narrator repository**: Fork the [Code-Narrator repository](https://github.com/ffrappo/code-narrator-turbo) on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.

6. **Set OPENAI_API_KEY in .env file**: In the project's root directory, create a `.env` file and set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your OpenAI API key. Replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

7. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

After completing these prerequisites, you should be able to work with and modify the Code-Narrator project.
