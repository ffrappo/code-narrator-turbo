# DefaultSettings.ts

This is a TypeScript code file that defines the `DefaultSettings` class. The class is responsible for providing default settings for the Code Narrator application. It includes various settings such as file paths, plugin configurations, and GPT system commands.

## Usage

To use the `DefaultSettings` class, simply import it and call the `get()` method to retrieve the default settings.

```typescript
import DefaultSettings from "./DefaultSettings";

const settings = DefaultSettings.get();
```

## Methods

### get(): ICodeNarratorConfig

This method returns an object containing the default settings for the Code Narrator application. The returned object implements the `ICodeNarratorConfig` interface.

### getFilesToExclude(): string[]

This private static method returns an array of file and folder paths that should be excluded from the documentation generation process. It combines the contents of the `.gitignore` file with a list of default exclusions.

## Properties

### gptModel: string

This static property holds the GPT model version to be used by the application. The default value is `'gpt-4-1106-preview'`.

## ICodeNarratorConfig Interface

The `ICodeNarratorConfig` interface defines the structure of the configuration object returned by the `get()` method. It includes properties such as file paths, plugin configurations, and GPT system commands.

## Technical Concepts

### FileStructure

The `FileStructure` utility is used to interact with the file system. It is used in the `getFilesToExclude()` method to read the contents of the `.gitignore` file.

### OpenAIService

The `OpenAIService` class is used to interact with the OpenAI API. An instance of this class is included in the default settings object returned by the `get()` method.

## Notes and Warnings

- The `cache_file` property is set to `.code-narrator-turbo/cache.json`. This file should be committed into the Git repository to ensure proper functioning of the application.
